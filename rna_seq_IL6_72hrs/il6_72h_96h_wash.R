#Filtering lowly expressed genes#
###############################

#Genes with very low counts across all libraries provide little evidence for differential expression and they interfere with some of the 
#statistical approximations that are used later in the pipeline. They also add to the multiple testing burden when estimating false discovery rates, 
#reducing power to detect differentially expressed genes. These genes should be filtered out prior to further analysis.

#counts-per-million (CPM) above 0.5 in at least two samples
# Obtain CPMs
myCPM <- cpm(gene.counts)
# Have a look at the output
head(myCPM)

# Which values in myCPM are greater than 0.5?
thresh <- myCPM > 0.5
# This produces a logical matrix with TRUEs and FALSEs
head(thresh)

# Summary of how many TRUEs there are in each row
# There are 11433 genes that have TRUEs in all 12 samples.
table(rowSums(thresh))

# we would like to keep genes that have at least 2 TRUES in each row of thresh

summary(keep)

# Subset the rows of countdata to keep the more highly expressed genes
counts.keep <- gene.counts[keep,]

dim(counts.keep)


#A CPM of 0.5 is used as it corresponds to a count of 10-15 for the library sizes in this data set. If the count is any smaller, it is considered to 
#be very low, indicating that the associated gene is not expressed in that sample. A requirement for expression in two or more libraries is used as 
#each group contains two replicates. This ensures that a gene will be retained if it is only expressed in one group. Smaller CPM thresholds are 
#usually appropriate for larger libraries. As a general rule, a good threshold can be chosen by identifying the CPM that corresponds to a count of 10, 
#which in this case is about 0.5. You should filter with CPMs rather than filtering on the counts directly, as the latter does not account for
#differences in library sizes between samples.
